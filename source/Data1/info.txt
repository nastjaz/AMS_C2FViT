ThoraxCBCT 

With the release of the ThoraxCBCT dataset the registration problem of image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) between pre-therapeutic fan beam CT (FBCT) and interventional low dose cone beam CT (CBCT) is addressed. 
The released image data is part of the 4D-Lung dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive which contains four-dimensional lung images acquired during radiochemotherapy of locally-advanced, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=21267414.

For each patient one FBCT prior to therapy in maximum inspiration is provided which is denoted by the filename ending _0000.nii.gz. Further, there are two CBCTs for each patient, one at the beginning of therapy (_0001.nii.gz) and one at the end of therapy (_0002.nii.gz). Both are acquired in maximum expiration. 
The task is to find one solution for the registration of two pairs of images per patient:
1. The planning FBCT (inspiration) prior to therapy and the low dose CBCT at the beginning of therapy (expiration), which are acquired at similar timepoints, and 
2. The planning FBCT (inspiration) prior to therapy and the low dose CBCT at the end of therapy (expiration), where longer periods of time (usually several months) lay in between the scans. 

The challenge in both pairs of images is the registration of images from the two different modalities FBCT and CBCT and also the shift in breathing phases between maximum inspiration and expiration. In the second subtask there is an additional challenge with the time shift between the planning CT at the beginning of therapy and the follow up CBCT at the end of therapy. 

The released dataset includes training images of 11 patients resulting in 11 FBCT and 22 CBCT images, and validation images of 3 patients with 3 FBCT and 6 CBCT images. The images are paired as described above with two image pairs per patient, resulting in 22 image pairs for training and 6 image pairs for validation. Additionally, Foerstner keypoints are provided in two folders: �keypoints01Tr� and �keypoints02Tr�. This has changed with regard to previous L2R releases, due to the FBCT images being used in two image pairings. The keypoints were created based on displacements resulting from registration with convexAdam (the winning algorithm for the L2R23 ThoraxCBCT task) for every image pair, which leads to two different keypoint files for every FBCT image. The keypoints for the first subtask (FBCT, CBCT beginning of therapy) are stored in �keypoints01Tr� with the filename ending _0000.csv denoting the keypoints for the FBCT (_0000.nii.gz) and _0001.csv for the CBCT (_0001.nii.gz). 
Along this denotation the keypoints for the second subtask are stored in �keypoints02Tr� with again the FBCT keypoint filename ending being _0000.csv and _0002.csv for the CBCT at the end of therapy (_0002.nii.gz). The correspondences for the validation cases will not be published yet. 


In contrast to previous tasks, the focus of this task is not mainly on the lung, but also on other thoracic organs, especially organs at risk with regard to radiotherapy, which is why the keypoints were determined not only in the lung, but in the entire trunc region.

The test dataset includes images of 5 patients resulting in 5 FBCT and 10 CBCT images, translating to 10 image pairs for testing. The manual annotations for the test data include multiple segmentation masks (lung, tumor, organs at risk (heart, spinal cord, esophagus, etc.)) as well as anatomical landmarks such as airway bifurcations, top of aortic arch, apex cordis and bone structures such as the sternum, ribs, clavicles and vertebrae. Both TRE and Dice coefficients will be used in the evaluation. 

Along with the test data, additional body-trunc masks are provided for every image, which are binary masks differentiating between the whole trunc region and the image background. Please look into the subtask "body_trunc" of the TotalSegmentator for more information (https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator). 

For details on the image acquisition (scanner details etc.) please see https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=21267414. All images are converted to nifti, resampled and cropped to the region of interest (thorax) resulting in an image size of 256, 192, 192 with a voxel spacing of 1.5x1.5x1.5mm.
